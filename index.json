We can discern surfaces whose elements are tens of nanometers in size and hundreds of nanometers apart. The perception of texture not only allows us to make fine discriminations – like telling real silk from fake silk – but also guides object manipulation. For example, our perception of the surface properties of objects informs how much grip force we apply on them: more force is required for slippery objects. One of the remarkable aspects of tactile texture processing is that it operates over six orders of magnitude in element sizes, from the smallest discernible elements (on the order of tens of nanometers) to the largest elements that can fit on a fingertip, measured in tens of millimeters. We have shown that this wide range of scales is accommodated by distributing information across three types of nerve fibers, each sensitive to surface elements over different spatial scales. Importantly, these different afferents convey texture information differently. Coarse textural features, on the order of millimeters, are conveyed in the spatial pattern of activation in one afferent population, drawing analogies to visual texture representations on the retina.\nIn contrast, fine textural features – with sizes in the tens of nanometers – are conveyed in temporal spiking patterns in two other afferent populations, driven by skin vibrations elicited when the textured surface moves across the skin, and drawing analogies to audition. How these two types of representations are integrated to achieve a unitary sensory experience of texture is a mystery. Furthermore, while afferent responses are highly dependent on exploratory parameters, such as contact force and scanning speed, the perception of texture is highly invariant with respect to these parameters. Thus, neural signals must be interpreted in the context of how they are acquired. Nothing is known about how this is achieved.\nProprioception Sensory signals about the posture and movements of our hands are critical to our ability to dexterously interact with objects. Despite its importance, little is known about how hand proprioception is encoded in the responses of neurons in primary somatosensory cortex (S1). To fill this gap, we track the movements of the hand as animals perform different motor tasks using state-of-the-art motion tracking while recording the activity evoked in S1 neurons using chronically implanted multi electrode arrays. We then use a variety of mathematical techniques to reveal how information about hand movements and posture is encoded in the responses of populations of S1 neurons.\nNeural Coding in the Brainstem The responses of individual peripheral afferents convey ambiguous information about tactile stimuli, while those of cortical neurons explicitly carry information about behaviorally relevant stimulus features. Little is known about the response properties of neurons in the two intervening structures in the medial lemniscal pathway, namely the dorsal column nuclei and the ventroposterior nucleus of the thalamus. In collaboration with Lee Miller and Joshua Rosenow at Northwestern University, we have developed an approach to chronically implant electrode arrays in the cuneate nucleus (CN) of primates (the nucleus in the dorsal columns that relays input from the upper limb) so that we are able, for the first time, to record single unit activity from this structure in awake, behaving animals. From these recordings, we hope to compare stimulus representations in CN to their counterparts at the periphery and in cortex, to glean a better understanding of the role of this neural structure in sensory information processing.\nNeuroprosthetics One approach to restoring sensorimotor function in amputees or tetraplegic patients consists in equipping them with anthropomorphic robotic arms that are interfaced directly with the nervous system. To control these arms, not only must motor intention be translated into movements of the limb, but sensory signals must be transmitted from the limb to the patient. Indeed, without these signals, controlling the arm is very slow, clumsy, and effortful. With this in mind, we develop approaches to convey meaningful and naturalistic sensations through stimulation of peripheral or cortical neurons, attempting to reproduce, to the extent possible, the patterns of neuronal activation that are relevant for basic object interactions. We anticipate that these studies will constitute an important step towards restoring the sense of touch to those who have lost it.\n","permalink":"/projects/","tags":null,"title":"Lab Projects"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Present and past members of the lab.\n","permalink":"/team/","tags":null,"title":"Lab Members"},{"categories":null,"contents":"   Article Publication Date     Man undergoes surgery, receives robotic arm NBC Morning News Nov 2019   Weird illusion makes you think fabric is moving faster than it is New Scientist Aug 2019   The instant, custom, connected future of medical devices New York Times Feb 2019   The magic touch: bringing sensory feedback to brain-controlled prosthetics Medical Devices Network Jan 2019   $3.4 million grant to support development of brain-controlled prosthetic limbs UChicago News Oct 2018   Neuroprosthetics and the future of artificial touch Curiosity Oct 2017   Computer model simulates sense of touch from the entire hand UCMC Science Life Jun 2017   Artifical hand helps amputee feel softness CBS News Oct 2016   Restoring the sense of touch in amputees using natural signals of the nervous system UCMC Science Life Oct 2016   Researchers help paralyzed man regain sense of touch through a robotic arm UChicago News Oct 2016   In a medical first, brain implant allows paralyzed man to feel again The Washington Post Oct 2016   The secret of Cashmere\u0026rsquo;s luxurious appeal Discover Magazine Jul 08, 2016   The neurophysiology of touch Journal of Neurophysiology Podcasts June 2016   Three Chicago research facilities are changing the world of prosthetics Chicago Health Online Feb 2016   Ideas in movement: The next wave of brain-computer interfaces Nature Medicine Jan 2016   Sheet music for creating the artificial sense of touch UCMC Science Life October 2015   Whether you touch or see, your brain tracks movement mostly the same way Medical Daily September 2015   Brain teasers Discovery Series March 2015   HAPTIX – University of Utah UNews February 2015   HAPTIX – Case Western Reserve University The Daily February 2015   Why the sense of touch is like a concert UCMC Science Life September 2014   Once more with feelin’ The Groks Science Show August 2014   The accidental neuroscientist UCMC Science Life April 2014    Russia 2 November 2013   Touching me, touching you Science Life Podcast November 2013   New bionic arm: bigger faster stronger, more sensitive The Voice of Russia November 2013   How do you feel?
